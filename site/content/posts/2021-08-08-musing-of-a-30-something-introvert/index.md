## "Start typing content here..."

10 minutes was spent staring at the innocuous placeholder text trying to figure out where to begin. It is an odd feeling having so many things running through your head simultaneously but also have no idea what to say. 

My partner is often quoting one of her university lecturers in regards to understanding problems faced in the context of primary school teaching:

> "Look at self first" - Some university lecturer

## Who am I, really?

I feel as though I know myself pretty well. Many of my personality traits by design put me on the outside compared to my peers. I've been a sceptical person since a very young age. Despite Catholic schooling and compulsory church attendance the concept of a God never made sense to me. I can be blunt and often tell the truth where others dodge and weave it for the sake of someone's feelings or to save face. I am a challenging person. I have always been argumentative, however I'm not scared of being wrong. Failing is one more step towards succeeding.

There are only a handful of people who can handle me but for better or worse this is who I am. Keeping friends has always been difficult but it seems more apparent since I entered my 30's. I didn't start university until 27 while the majority of my highschool friends already have houses and multiple kids. That has definitely put a strain on some already strained relationships. 

## The slow climb to "success"

The concept of success is a funny one. By my measure overall success has been slow. The greatest success in my life was that my aforementioned partner and love of my life found me. Eliza understands me like no other person can (really there is only one other person that comes close). We built our relationship upon debt, near poverty and constantly moving around but underpinning all of those hard things is understanding and love and truth. 

Eliza gave me the push I needed to persue my goals and stop being a slave to the things that shaped my status quo. I discovered what a close knit family was really like and where I was accepted, though it has been hard to come to terms with the reality of my own family. 

I was "the late baby" in a family of 5 kids. A family that (at least since I was born) was never happy. My parents split and got back together several times since I was as young as 3 years old. Around when I turned 16 they split for good, though that ship should have sailed probably long before I was born. I was born into a broken family which only got more so as I grew up. I honestly hate thinking about it. Some parts of it make me so mad. Even now I am made to feel like a child at family gatherings, which has only fermented my feeling that they should be avoided at all costs. 

I have been told that there is a "mode" that I engage at my family events where I regress to a former version of myself. It surely can't be healthy that this happens.
